## üçï Dominos Pizza - House Discord Bot 
This was a discord bot that orders a two or three topping pizza from the nearest *Dominos* location and applies the corresponding coupon to make it super cheap! I had the idea since my housemates would often find ourselves too lazy to go through the annoying process of ordering one ourselves. 

To use the bot, clone this repository, add your discord token to the bot.py file inside the client.run() command. Also, to make this bot work, you will need to correctly set up your chromedriver depending on if you are a Windows or Mac user. Run the bot using python bot.py or python3 bot.py.
